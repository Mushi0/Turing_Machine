# Proper Turing Machine Chat Bot

A bot to play [turing machine board game](https://www.turingmachine.info/) without laying out all the cards. 

This version of the chat bot includes all the criteria cards, punch cards, as well as all the verification cards. It solved the problem that the [old version on PICO-8](https://github.com/Mushi0/my_turing_machine_bot_pico-8) is not able to use the criterias in which *the colour is not specified* (e.g., criteria card `26`). 

It requres the player to input the game set up -- criteria cards and verification cards seperated by comas (e.g., `4,9,11,14,G447,G646,G566,G322`), where the verification card colour are indicated with the initial letter: Green(`G`), Orange(`O`), Blue(`B`), and Purple(`P`). More game settings can be found on the [turing machine official website](https://www.turingmachine.info/).
